Description: siduction defaults for apt
 apt 0.7 basically transforms apt into aptitude, revert to traditional apt
 behaviour as far as that is possible by disabling, among others, the
 automatic installation of recommends (and suggests), as well as disabling
 and hiding the autoremove functionality.
